# Local Home SDK Reference
The Local Home SDK provides the TypeScript typings for building applications
that support local execution for smart home integrations with the Google Assistant.

These typings are distributed as an
[npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/local-home-sdk).
The source code can be found in the
[Local Home SDK GitHub repo](https://github.com/actions-on-google/local-home-sdk).

The SDK is available via Googleâ€™s content delivery network (CDN). To use it,
add the following lines:

```
<head>
  <script src="//www.gstatic.com/eureka/smarthome/smarthome_sdk.js"></script>
</head>
```

To get started using the Local Home SDK for smart home Actions, see the
[local execution guide](/assistant/smarthome/concepts/local).
